    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am a UVIC computer science student. This is a personal project of mine to display future projects of mine.</p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>I was lead level designer for the videogame RAM: Random Acess Mayhem on steam. <b\>
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2256450/RAM_Random_Access_Mayhem/">Check RAM: Random Access Mayhem out on Steam</a>
    </b>
    I was tasked with planning encounter spaces, encounter and enemy types, and general moment to moment gameplay feel on each level. 
    I would then build the playspace and test it along with coworkers and testers.</p>
